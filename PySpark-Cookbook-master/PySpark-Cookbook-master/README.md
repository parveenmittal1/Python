This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Configure a local instance of PySpark in a virtual environment
* Install and configure Jupyter in local and multi-node environments
* Create DataFrames from JSON and a dictionary using pyspark.sql
* Explore regression and clustering models available in the ML module
* Use DataFrames to transform data used for modeling
